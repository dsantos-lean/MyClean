## Story Points: 8

## Assumptions:
- Customers will rate and review cleaners after completing a service.  
- Ratings are numeric (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) and reviews are optional written feedback.  
- Cleaners' ratings and reviews are aggregated and displayed on their profiles.  
- Data privacy is maintainedâ€”reviews will not include sensitive customer information.  

## Description
As a **user**, I want to see performance ratings and reviews for each of my cleaners so that I can evaluate their service quality before booking.

## Tasks
1. Design Rating and Review Submission UI (half day)
   - Create an interface for customers to rate and review cleaners after service completion.
   - Include fields for numeric ratings and optional written feedback.

2. Implement Rating Aggregation Logic (1.5 days)
   - Develop backend logic to calculate and display the average rating for each cleaner.
   - Ensure reviews are linked to corresponding cleaners and stored securely.

3. Display Ratings and Reviews on Profiles (half day)
   - Update cleaner profiles to showcase aggregated ratings and recent reviews.
   - Design profile sections to make ratings visually appealing (e.g., star icons).
