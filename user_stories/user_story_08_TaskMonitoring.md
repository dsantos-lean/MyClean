# User Story Title: Task Monitoring

## Priority: 40

## Estimation: 4 days  
- Lean: 4 days  
- Jeomin: 2 days  
- Dea: 2 days  
- Adithyan: 3 days  

## Assumptions:
- Employees will update their task status on the platform in real time.  
- Tasks will be assigned to employees by the cleaning company through the system.  
- Monitoring will include both task progress (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed") and task details (e.g., location, assigned employee, and timeline).  
- The system will provide a dashboard view for cleaning companies to track task statuses.  

## Description:
As a **cleaning company**, I want the ability to track my employeesâ€™ task status so that I can ensure timely service delivery and operational efficiency.

## Tasks
1. Design Task Status Dashboard (1 day)
   - Create a dashboard view for cleaning companies to monitor task statuses and assigned employees.
   - Include filtering options (e.g., by employee name, task progress, or location).


2. Employee Task Update Interface (2 days)
   - Create an interface for employees to update their task status (e.g., "Pending," "In Progress," "Completed").
   - Validate input to ensure proper task updates without errors.

3. Notifications for Task Status Changes (1 day)
   - Implement notifications for cleaning companies to alert them of task updates (e.g., task completion).
   - Include a log of notifications within the dashboard for review.
